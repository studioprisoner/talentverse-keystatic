Biometric authentication is a security measure that uses a person's unique physiological or behavioral characteristics to verify their identity. This type of authentication is becoming increasingly popular in various industries because it provides a high level of security and convenience.

Biometric authentication can use a variety of physical traits, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, or voice recognition, to confirm an individual's identity. By leveraging unique features of a person's body or behavior, biometric authentication can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access, identity theft, and other forms of cybercrime.
